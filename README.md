Python Console Pokemon Game

Important Note: Not all Software Requirements are implemented. Other important functionalities are also not yet implemented. For the most important
requirements to be inplemented, search for 'todo' in the code. These include:
- Let Pokemon die. Cap health at 0 and remove from deck if they die. 
- End state: if all pokemon of a certain player are dead, stop the game.

Description.
The assignment is to make a small console-based Pokemon Game. The goal of the game is to allow a player to select a Pokemon from a range of choices 
and to initiate a fighting sequence with another Pokemon. The fighting happens turn-based. Each Pokemon gets a turn to attack, until one Pokemonâ€™s 
health is depleted. The complexity of the game mechanics is secondary, our main interest is what you have built under the hood.

Software Requirements
1. Main menu so the user can initiate actions.
2. List all available Pokemon and be able to choose one as your main Pokemon. Create as many Pokemon as you like, with a minimum of 5.
3. Being able to change your main Pokemon at any time.
4. Ability to initiate a fighting sequence. Before actually fighting, we pick an opposing Pokemon.
5. An overview of what happens during the fight. Who is attacking who, what are the current health stats, etc.
